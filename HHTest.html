        <p>In the grim dark future of the 41st millenium, there is only war.</p>
        <p>Yet this was not always so. For in the time of <em>The Great Crusade</em>, <strong>The God Emperor</strong> reached across the stars to unite the lost worlds of humanity with Holy Terra and return them into the fold of <strong>The Imperium of Man</strong>.</p>   
        <p>But as hopeful as this dream was, it was but a dream. A dream that humanity, and The Emperor were rudely awoken from.</p>
        <p>At the peak of <em>The Gread Crusade</em>, Horus Lupercal, <em>the Warmaster</em> and most favored son of The Emperor was seduced by the forces of Chaos. The archtraitor then corrupeted half of his fellow Priamarchs and their astartes legions to turn against the Imperium and set the galaxy in flames.</p>
        <p>This great betrayal was forever entombed into the annals of history as <strong>The Horus Heresy</strong>.</p>
    
        <h2>The Great Crusade</h2>

        <p>In the 32nd millenium, the dreams of conquering the stars and uniting holy Terra's lost worlds were a hopeful reality. Imperial records designate this holy dream and the 200 years prior to <em>The Heresy</em> as <strong>The Great Crusade</strong>.</p>
        <p>This was a golden age. The Master of Mankind walked across the stars. The 20 Primarchs led the <em>legiones astartes</em> to spread the Imperial Truth. Gods walked among humanity while reconquering Terra's lost worlds and repelling the xenos threats.</p>
        <p>At the centre of The Great Crusade were the 20 astartes legions. These soldiers were bred from the geneseeds of their respective Primarchs during <em>The Unification Wars</em> of Terra prior to The Great Crusade.</p>
        <h3><em>Legiones Astartes</em> (Prior to The Great Crusade):</h3>

            <li>Ghost Legion</li>
        </ol>

        <p>While the purpose of The Great Crusade was to reclaim humanity's lost majesty, this endeavor was also meant for The Master of Mankind to reunite with His lost sons; the Primarchs.</p>
        <p>Each Primarch were discovered on a lost world in which they sat as absolute ruler. Through no feats but their own, the Primarchs, as sons of The Emperor of Man, grew to lead their own isolated domains within The Imperium. These demi-gods, while possessing gifts bestowed upon them from The Emperor, also adopted the cultures of their adopted worlds. Upon returning to The Imperium, like a father embracing a lost son, each Primarch dutifully inherited their Father's teachings and their roles within His grand scheme for humanity. Similar was said to have occurred when each astartes legion welcomed their respected geneseed fathers.</p>
        <p>As such, while integrating their Primarchs' teachings and customs, most astartes also adopted many aspects of their father's adopted homeworlds. A common occurence were the adoption of new colors and heraldry. The follwowing is a list of the <em>legiones astartes</em> as they were known throughout The Great Crusade and <em>The Horus Heresy</em> as well as the names of each legions respective Primarchs.</p>
