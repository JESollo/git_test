# git_test
My first GitHub repo!

All files and directories within this repository are simply experiments and exercises outlined by The Odin Project - Foundations course. 

This was the first repository that I ever created and should not be used as a reflection of my current skills. 

This repository merely holds sentimental and nostalgic value.
